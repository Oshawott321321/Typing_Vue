      Typer

      I am thinking about building a web based application in which user can practive his/her fingers to type fast on keyboard.
      Project will get divided into 2 pieces
      1.Backend
      2.Frontend

      Backend will authenticate and store data about user and multiple types of data will get collected and vizulized on dashboard.

      On Frontend whole application will get served and user will intract with it.

      In this app , i want to implement a neural network model to train user's fingers and provide those keys to train on those they lack.

      I have decided to build a web based application in which user can practice typing on WEB and train his/her fingers to type fast on keyboard.

      Backend will authenticate and store data about user and multiple types of data will get collected and will get visualized on dashboard.
      In Authentication , I will use either JWT tokens or OAuth2.

      In Frontend, Whole application will get developed using Vue3.
      Whole application will get served on Heroku on Internet and for demonstrating purpose i will serve that app on Nginx on my local server.

      In this app , i want to implement a Machine Learning / Neural network model to train user's fingers and provide words according to practice on those keys to train on those they lack.
